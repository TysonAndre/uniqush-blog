Google announced
[GCM](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/index.html) on Google
IO 2012 two days before. It is a push notification service to replace
[C2DM](http://code.google.com/android/c2dm/).

Two days later, you can use [uniqush](http://uniqush.org) to send notifications to android devices using
[GCM](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/index.html). The latest [API document](http://uniqush.org/wiki/UniqushAPIs) contains details on using GCM.

The latest version of uniqush now is 1.3.x. Instead of installing from source code, binary packages including .deb and .tar.gz format will be online soon. (No later than July 2, 2012.)
