We have just released a new version of uniqush-push, it's version 1.3.2 now.
This version fixed some bugs and merged four repositories into single one.
Details are in the [release
note](http://uniqush.org/release-notes/rn-uniqush-push-1-3-2.html). The two bugs fixed in this version were all reported by Ivan Yu which is one of uniqush's users and active on the mailing list. Special thank to him.
