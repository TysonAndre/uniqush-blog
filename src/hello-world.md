Title: Hello World! Hello Uniqush!
Tags: uniqush, golang
Slug: hello-world

I started [uniqush](http://uniqush.org) in Aug. 2011, when I was reading
documents about push service. The idea of this project is simple: build a
software as a proxy between the app server and push services, so that the
server side programmer could use a simple and consistent interface to push
message to any mobile device.

After about one month of development, the first functional version was online
and also the [web site](http://uniqush.org). Once it becomes a free/open-source
software project, it is more than coding work. Maintaining such a project is
[not a trivial work](http://antirez.com/post/one-year-of-redis.html) even for
experienced developers. Although I did not widely announce the birth of
uniqush, I did make my best effort to build a bridge between my project and my
(potential) users. That is why I spend lots of time on [drawing
work](http://uniqush.org/wiki/UniqushStory), and hence this blog.

Interaction with users are crucial to a software project. Although
[github](http://github.com/monnand/uniqush) provides plenty of means for such
purpose, a blog may be a simple and effective way to make announcement and get
feedback immediately.

Hence, I set up this blog hoping to hear the voice from the early or potential
users of uniqush. If you have any comment on this project, please let me know.
